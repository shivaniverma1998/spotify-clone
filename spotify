This simplified Spotify clone project allows you to add songs to a playlist and control playback.
It includes features like playing the current song, moving to the next
or previous song in the playlist, and displaying the playlist.

Please note that this example doesn't include features like audio streaming, user authentication,
or music catalog management, which are integral to the real Spotify app. 
Building a complete Spotify clone with all its advanced features would require a more 
comprehensive and sophisticated implementation using languages and frameworks like JavaScript, Python, or Swift.
